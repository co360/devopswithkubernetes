Against [better judgement](https://vsupalov.com/docker-latest-tag/) I used the "latest" tag for some assignments and Kubernetes `yaml` configurations. That's why some solutions can't be played through again, because the automatically built Image at Docker Hub doesn't match the step of the solution anymore. This is especially true for the main application. The project on the other hand is logically tagged.
